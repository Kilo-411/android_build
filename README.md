This Root might not be a ROM capable root but you will have SU privledges and be able to run root apps.
Now i didnt intend to root my phone.. It was sorta buy accident and opportunity.
My phone had a error msg that is on here but no one answered. So i looked at other people with there similar issues and never did find a fix, its still not fixed.
# proot info: vpid 1: terminated with signal 11
# |-)))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))))
I know some of you guys can fix this and be right on ur way. Well not me :( . after that came bash code of bash: [: : integer expression expected) another error and here am on a an android devise and the only stuff i used to like doing was going after pot of gold.
Well i did a little investigating and came to a similar problem again but diffrent phone year and all. And my phone carrier (T-Mobile) shh" says UNLIMITED Data but that aint exactly true is it. I seen a fix for that error and i was looking in on how i could fix this slow internet and when i seen the code i relized that termux even tho i dont have Root i can still do stuff through termux code . i hate to say termux is linux but i guess it is linux without the linux.. The more pkg you install the more options and tools at your finger tips.
So i had all of them. I downloaded the big file of SECCOM and HUGE file for c++ and prolly 200 small filez like joe when ever i would come to a dead end.i would just install another file and keep going.So any ways i came to this fix for someone on github about a year or 2 ago and i saw a real chance. It was an easy code an.i seen dealt with it before especially on ssh back in 2001 it was this.

And like i said what a great way to edit and switch stuff around .. I was going at about 6kbs i put this i dunno how to say it so well call it < throttle hack > and i went from 6kbs to 135 kbs instanly. And that was first run. Im up to over 1 mgbs on roaming and coming off a tower that has no gsm it has Lte and wcmda. So basicly im getting 4g LTE speed in exchange for 2g. Im submitting this small hack today under listing Throttle Hack . Ok so once i got my speed up i seen another error with termux .. Styling was not loading due to no PATH way for it .. I dunno how
But the way the files was suppose to go they had missing files. Prolly that Droid maid app that thing gets rid of files but some need those files to do a desired or set path. Not an easy fix remind you i have only hacking abilitys that are 10 years old and i aint got no knoledge of the whole break down of termux. So o get back at it and nope i cant create a file in system/bin i can move copy send or share. I was again at a dead end. And of course its time to install another pkg. This time it was call nano proot. Well i installed it and tryed to cd to nano. Well when i did i found myaelf
In a terminal with options like remove folder replace with another. All kinds of stuff you will need if u are gonna root your phone the way did. So.i took one file out of the string that went on and its name waz just:files; and i seen a change happen. Bash waz gone so was alot of featurrs.well all of a sec its.not bash anymore its now ndk and its crazy and of no sudo can be made of course so i got Mad cause now i forgot my pazsword but no proble. Cause.im a 1st generation hacker. Well i start investigating and soon realize was on the phone with sometexh telling me my aacount wadmt there.. And i dod try to grant any pwz
